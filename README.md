# Cisco Packet Tracer Project - Configuring DNS, DHCP, Web Server and IP Helper Command for DHCP Relay on a SOHO Network

The goal of this exercise was the following:

Configure a DHCP server and enable it so that all devices on the network can be automatically assigned an IP across subnets.
Configure a DNS server by enabling it and inputting a DNS record to ensure that google.com can be reached via the web server.
Configure a web server so that devices on the network can reach the aforementioned google.com.
This network topology includes:

a router with two interfaces separating two subnetworks
5 client machines on the first subnet
3 servers and 2 client machines in the second subnet
